Disclaimer: This is a data-analysis project, so there is no code to "use" unless you want to set up and load the database yourself. Though I imagine you wouldn't want to do that, as it takes forever to load data into our database.

# SETUP

1. Create a root schema in MySQL called "group20" using the provided DDL file (backup).
2. Download the Million Playlist Dataset and place the first slice in the same folder as DataLoading.ipynb.
3. Enter your root password where indicated in DataLoading.ipynb and run every cell.

Our queries (in the queries file) can then be used. DataAnalysis.ipynb includes the code used for creating data visualizations of some of our query results.
